<font size="+5"><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></font>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
<p>For your knowledge, the terms: we, us and our refer to @sky.bet.championship in the following notice.</p>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seeks to protect and enhance the rights of data subjects. These rights cover the safeguarding of personal data, protection against the unlawful processing of personal data and the unrestricted movement of personal data within the EU. GDPR does not apply to information already in the public domain.</p>

<p>We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Notice applies to personal data (i.e. information concerning any living person (A Data Subject)) held by us as data controllers that is not already in the public domain. It explains what personal information we collect, how we collect and use that personal information, with whom we will share it, why and in what circumstances.</p>

<p>We are pleased to provide the following Privacy Notice which covers our websites, and mobile websites (Platforms) except where you are notified of another privacy notice or policy by the specific entity which collects your personal information.</p>

<p>You may find external links to third party websites on our Platforms and those websites may have their own privacy notices which are different to this Privacy Notice. Our Privacy Notice does not apply to your use of a third party site and you should therefore make sure that you are comfortable with their privacy notices prior to using those sites.</p>
<br>
<h2>Personal Data</h2>
<br>
<p>We use the information collected from you to provide such organisational services as you request from us. In you making initial contact you consent to us maintaining a dialogue with you until you either opt out (which you can do at any stage) or we decide to desist from promoting our services.</p>

<p>The type of information that we may collect will differ depending on the type of service we are offering or the request you make of us. Such information could potentially include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>date of birth</li>
<li>address</li>
<li>contact details (including email address and/or telephone/mobile number)</li>
<li>gender</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only collect the information necessary so that we can provide you with our organisational services.</p>
<br>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<br>
<p>Our Platforms use cookies. A “cookie” is a small computer file that is downloaded to your device that enables a web server to collect information from your web browser. It collects information as to how you navigate our Platforms and helps us to identify you, to make your visit to our Platforms more enjoyable by personalising your visit by customising our web pages for you,and to build up a demographic profile. For more information on cookies and how to manage cookie settings, please go to our cookie policy. <a href="cookie-policy﻿">https://www.eflchampionship.co.uk/cookie-policy.html</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
<br>
<p>We will only collect, process, use, share and store your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis for doing so. This may be because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we need to use your personal information to take steps to enter into a contract with you or to meet our contractual obligations to you;</li>
<li>we need to use your personal information to respond to marketing or other enquiries from you;</li>
<li>we need to use your personal information to pursue our legitimate interests as an organisation;</li>
<li>we have your consent to using your personal information for a particular activity (for example, where you have consented to us sharing with you marketing or promotional communications from ourselves and/or our partners which we think may be of interest).</li>
</ul><br>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<br>
<p>You may withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time by contacting us (see the ‘How to Contact Us’ section below).</p>
<br>
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<br>

<p>We do not broker or pass on information gained from your engagement with us without your specific consent to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose your personal information to meet our legal obligations, to comply with applicable regulations or a valid governmental request, in order to enforce or apply the terms of use of any of the Platforms or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the members of @sky.bet.championship, our partners, and/or others.</p>
<br>
<h2>Retention Policy</h2>
<br>
<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and in line with our data retention policy.
